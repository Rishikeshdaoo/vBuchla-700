The *master branch* has an implementation of a working Synthesizer. 

The *buchlaimplementation branch* has the implementation of one of the recursive configs from Buchla 700. This implementation does not make any sound due to a difference in the signal processing architecture of Buchla700 and how JUCE works.
More details can be found in this [report](./VIP Fall 2020 - Buchla700.pdf)



This [repository](https://github.com/sandcobainer/buchla700-MAX) has the complete, working implementation of Buchla 700 in Max/MSP and Gen.
