To use this project in paid products you can buy a license at https://foleysfinest.com/developer/pluginguimagic/

The paid license entitles you to publish and sell products with the foleys_gui_magic included in which format you want.
You will get support on how to use it and how to integrate your own features into the gui builder by giving examples.

There won't be free individual support, like checking or fixing your code.

Feature requests and bug reports from license holders will be prioritised.
